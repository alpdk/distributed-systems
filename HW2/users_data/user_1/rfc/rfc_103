ir. And after a while the data transmission will be in
      mostly small segments.

      The suggestion here is that the TCP implementations need to
      actively attempt to combine small window allocations into larger
      windows, since the mechanisms for managing the window tend to lead
      to many small windows in the simplest minded implementations.

3.8.  Interfaces

  There are of course two interfaces of concern:  the user/TCP interface
  and the TCP/lower-level interface.  We have a fairly elaborate model
  of the user/TCP interface, but the interface to the lower level
  protocol module is left unspecified here, since it will be specified
  in detail by the specification of the lowel level protocol.  For the
  case that the lower level is IP we note some of the parameter values
  that TCPs might use.

  User/TCP Interface

    The following functional description of user commands to the TCP is,
    at best, fictional, since every operating system will have different
    facilities.  Consequent
