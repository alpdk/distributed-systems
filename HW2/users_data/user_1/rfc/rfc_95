  acknowledgment it advances SND.UNA.  The extent to which the values of
  these variables differ is a measure of the delay in the communication.
  The amount by which the variables are advanced is the length of the
  data in the segment.  Note that once in the ESTABLISHED state all
  segments must carry current acknowledgment information.

  The CLOSE user call implies a push function, as does the FIN control
  flag in an incoming segment.

  Retransmission Timeout

  Because of the variability of the networks that compose an
  internetwork system and the wide range of uses of TCP connections the
  retransmission timeout must be dynamically determined.  One procedure
  for determining a retransmission time out is given here as an
  illustration.

    An Example Retransmission Timeout Procedure

      Measure the elapsed time between sending a data octet with a
      particular s
