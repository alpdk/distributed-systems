tion. It is
    also important to preserve the return route to answer connection
    requests.

    Any lower level protocol will have to provide the source address,
    destination address, and protocol fields, and some way to determine
    the "TCP length", both to provide the functional equivlent service
    of IP and to be used in the TCP checksum.

3.9.  Event Processing

  The processing depicted in this section is an example of one possible
  implementation.  Other implementations may have slightly different
  processing sequences, but they should differ from those in this
  section only in detail, not in substance.

  The activity of the TCP can be characterized as responding to events.
  The events that occur can be cast into three categories:  user calls,
  arriving segments, and
