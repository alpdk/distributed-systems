processed
        in the SYN-RECEIVED state, but processing of SYN and ACK should
        not be repeated.  If the listen was not fully specified (i.e.,
        the foreign socket was not fully specified), then the
        unspecified fields should be filled in now.

      fourth other text or control

        Any other control or text-bearing segment (not containing SYN)
        must have an ACK and thus would be discarded by the ACK
        processing.  An incoming RST segment could not be valid, since
        it could not have been sent in response to anything sent by this
        incarnation of the connection.  So you are unlikely to get here,
        but if you do, drop the segment, and return.

    If the state is SYN-SENT then

      first check the ACK bit

        If the ACK bit is set

          If SEG.ACK =< ISS, or SEG.ACK > SND.NXT, send a reset (unless
          the RST bit is set, if so drop the segment and return)

            <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

          and discard the segment.  Return.
