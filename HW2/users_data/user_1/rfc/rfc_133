      Delete the TCB and return "error:  closing" responses to any
      queued SENDs, or RECEIVEs.

    SYN-RECEIVED STATE

      If no SENDs have been issued and there is no pending data to send,
      then form a FIN segment and send it, and enter FIN-WAIT-1 state;
      otherwise queue for processing after entering ESTABLISHED state.

    ESTABLISHED STATE

      Queue this until all preceding SENDs have been segmentized, then
      form a FIN segment and send it.  In any case, enter FIN-WAIT-1
      state.

    FIN-WAIT-1 STATE
    FIN-WAIT-2 STATE

      Strictly speaking, this is an error and should receive a "error:
      connection closing" response.  An "ok" response would be
      acceptable, too, as long as a second FIN is not emitted (the first
      FIN may be retransmitted though).
