                                                Functional Specification



      In providing interprocess communication facilities, the TCP must
      not only accept commands, but must also return information to the
      processes it serves.  The latter consists of:

        (a) general information about a connection (e.g., interrupts,
        remote close, binding of unspecified foreign socket).

        (b) replies to specific user commands indicating success or
        various types of failure.

      Open

        Format:  OPEN (local port, foreign socket, active/passive
        [, timeout] [, precedence] [, security/compartment] [, options])
        -> local connection name
