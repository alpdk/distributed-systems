SHED,
    FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK, TIME-WAIT),
    any unacceptable segment (out of window sequence number or
    unacceptible acknowledgment number) must elicit only an empty
    acknowledgment segment containing the current send-sequence number
    and an acknowledgment indicating the next sequence number expected
    to be received, and the connection remains in the same state.

    If an incoming segment has a security level, or compartment, or
    precedence which does not exactly match the level, and compartment,
    and precedence requested for the connection,a reset is sent and
    connection goes to the CLOSED state.  The reset takes its sequence
    number from the ACK field of the incoming segment.

  Reset Processing

  In all states except SYN-SENT, all reset (RST) segments are validated
  by checking their SEQ-fields.  A reset is valid if its sequence number
  is in the window.  In the SYN-SENT state (a RST received in response
  to an initial SYN), the RST is accep
