ce level to match ours this will be
    detected in the next segment it sends, and the connection will be
    terminated then).  If our SYN has been acknowledged (perhaps in this
    incoming segment) the precedence level of the incoming segment must
    match the local precedence level exactly, if it does not a reset
    must be sent.

    If the incoming segment has an ACK field, the reset takes its
    sequence number from the ACK field of the segment, otherwise the
    reset has sequence number zero and the ACK field is set to the sum
    of the sequence number and segment length of the incoming segment.
    The connection remains in the same state.
