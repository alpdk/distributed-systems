  important feature is the type of service.  This provides information
  to the gateway (or internet module) to guide it in selecting the
  service parameters to be used in traversing the next network.
  Included in the type of service information is the precedence of the
  datagram.  Datagrams may also carry security information to permit
  host and gateways that operate in multilevel secure environments to
  properly segregate datagrams for security considerations.

2.3.  The Host Environment

  The TCP is assumed to be a module in an operating system.  The users
  access the TCP much like they would access the file system.  The TCP
  may call on other operating system functions, for example, to manage
  data structures.  The actual interface to the network is assumed to be
  controlled by a device driver module.  The TCP does not call on the
  network device driver directly, but rather calls on the internet
  datagram protocol module which may in turn call on the device driver.

  The mechanisms of TCP d
