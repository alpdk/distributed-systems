gment and sequence field values are selected to make the
      reset sequence acceptable to the TCP that sent the offending
      segment.

      If the ACK bit is off, sequence number zero is used,

        <SEQ=0><ACK=SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN><CTL=RST,ACK>

      If the ACK bit is on,

        <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

      Return.

    If the state is LISTEN then

      first check for an RST

        An incoming RST should be ignored.  Return.

      second check for an ACK

        Any acknowledgment is bad if it arrives on a connection still in
        the LISTEN state.  An acceptable reset segment should be formed
        for any arriving ACK-bearing segment.  The RST should be
        formatted as follows:

          <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

        Return.

      third check for a SYN

        If the SYN bit is set, check the security.  If the
        security/compartment on the incoming segment does not exactly
        match the security/compartment in the TCB then send a reset and
        return.
