  When the SYN arrives at line 3, TCP B, being in a synchronized state,
  and the incoming segment outside the window, responds with an
  acknowledgment indicating what sequence it next expects to hear (ACK
  100).  TCP A sees that this segment does not acknowledge anything it
  sent and, being unsynchronized, sends a reset (RST) because it has
