hake is shown in figure 7 below.  The
  figures should be interpreted in the following way.  Each line is
  numbered for reference purposes.  Right arrows (-->) indicate
  departure of a TCP segment from TCP A to TCP B, or arrival of a
  segment at B from A.  Left arrows (<--), indicate the reverse.
  Ellipsis (...) indicates a segment which is still in the network
  (delayed).  An "XXX" indicates a segment which is lost or rejected.
  Comments appear in parentheses.  TCP states represent the state AFTER
  the departure or arrival of the segment (whose contents are shown in
  the center of each line).  Segment contents are shown in abbreviated
  form, with sequence number, control flags, and ACK field.  Other
  fields such as window, addresses, lengths, and text have been left out
  in the interest of clarity.
