not be informed.  If
          this connection was initiated with an active OPEN (i.e., came
          from SYN-SENT state) then the connection was refused, signal
          the user "connection refused".  In either case, all segments
          on the retransmission queue should be removed.  And in the
          active OPEN case, enter the CLOSED state and delete the TCB,
          and return.

      ESTABLISHED
      FIN-WAIT-1
      FIN-WAIT-2
      CLOSE-WAIT

        If the RST bit is set then, any outstanding RECEIVEs and SEND
        should receive "reset" responses.  All segment queues should be
        flushed.  Users should also receive an unsolicited general
        "connection reset" signal.  Enter the CLOSED state, delete the
        TCB, and return.

      CLOSING STATE
      LAST-ACK STATE
      TIME-WAIT

        If the RST bit is set then, enter the CLOSED state, delete the
        TCB, and return.
