indication the user must also send at least one data
  octet.  If the sending user also indicates a push, timely delivery of
  the urgent information to the destination process is enhanced.

  Managing the Window

  The window sent in each segment indicates the range of sequence
  numbers the sender of the window (the data receiver) is currently
  prepared to accept.  There is an assumption that this is related to
  the currently available data buffer space available for this
  connection.

  Indicating a large window encourages transmissions.  If more data
  arrives than can be accepted, it will be discarded.  This will result
  in excessive retransmissions, adding unnecessarily to the load on the
  network and the TCPs.  Indicating a small window may restrict the
  transmission of data to the point of introducing a round trip delay
  between each new segment transmitted.

  The mechanisms provided allow a TCP to advertise a large window and to
  subsequently advertise a much smaller window without having ac
