    fifth check the ACK field,

      if the ACK bit is off drop the segment and return

      if the ACK bit is on

        SYN-RECEIVED STATE

          If SND.UNA =< SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT then enter ESTABLISHED state
          and continue processing.

            If the segment acknowledgment is not acceptable, form a
            reset segment,

              <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

            and send it.

        ESTABLISHED STATE

          If SND.UNA < SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT then, set SND.UNA <- SEG.ACK.
          Any segments on the retransmission queue which are thereby
          entirely acknowledged are removed.  Users should receive
          positive acknowledgments for buffers which have been SENT and
          fully acknowledged (i.e., SEND buffer should be returned with
          "ok" response).  If the ACK is a duplicate
          (SEG.ACK < SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK
