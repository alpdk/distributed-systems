edgment of the form:

          <SEQ=SND.NXT><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>

        This acknowledgment should be piggybacked on a segment being
        transmitted if possible without incurring undue delay.

      TIME-WAIT STATE

        This should not occur, since a FIN has been received from the
        remote side.  Ignore the segment text.

    eighth, check the FIN bit,

      Do not process the FIN if the state is CLOSED, LISTEN or SYN-SENT
      since the SEG.SEQ cannot be validated; drop the segment and
      return.

      If the FIN bit is set, signal the user "connection closing" and
      return any pending RECEIVEs wit
