NT ARRIVES



        FIN-WAIT-1 STATE

          In addition to the processing for the ESTABLISHED state, if
          our FIN is now acknowledged then enter FIN-WAIT-2 and continue
          processing in that state.

        FIN-WAIT-2 STATE

          In addition to the processing for the ESTABLISHED state, if

        CLOSE-WAIT STATE

          Do the same processing as for the ESTABLISHED state.

        CLOSING STATE

          In addition to the processing for the ESTABLISHED state, if
          the ACK acknowledges our FIN then enter the TIME-WAIT state,
          otherwise ignore the segment.

        LAST-ACK STATE

          The only thing that can arrive in this state is an
          acknowledgment of our FIN.  If our FIN is now acknowledged,
          delete the TCB, enter the CLOSED state, and return.
