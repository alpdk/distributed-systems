          The precedence in the segment must match the precedence in the
          TCB, if not, send a reset

            <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

        If there is no ACK

          If the precedence in the segment is higher than the precedence
          in the TCB then if allowed by the user and the system raise
          the precedence in the TCB to that in the segment, if not
          allowed to raise the prec then send a reset.

            <SEQ=0><ACK=SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN><CTL=RST,ACK>

          If the precedence in the segment is lower than the precedence
          in the TCB continue.

        If a reset was sent, discard the segment and return.

      fourth check the SYN bit

        This step should be reached only if the ACK is ok, or there is
        no ACK, and it the segment did not contain a RST.

        If the SYN bit is on and the security/compartment and precedence
