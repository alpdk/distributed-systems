tering ESTABLISHED state.
      If no space to queue, respond with "error:  insufficient
      resources".

    ESTABLISHED STATE
    CLOSE-WAIT STATE

      Segmentize the buffer and send it with a piggybacked
      acknowledgment (acknowledgment value = RCV.NXT).  If there is
      insufficient space to remember this buffer, simply return "error:
      insufficient resources".

      If the urgent flag is set, then SND.UP <- SND.NXT-1 and set the
      urgent pointer in the outgoing segments.
