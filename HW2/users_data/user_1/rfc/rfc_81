  continue to try to establish the connection; the problem is now
  reduced to the basic 3-way handshake of figure 7.

  An interesting alternative case occurs when TCP A crashes and TCP B
  tries to send data on what it thinks is a synchronized connection.
  This is illustrated in figure 11.  In this case, the data arriving at
  TCP A from TCP B (line 2) is unacceptable because no such connection
  exists, so TCP A sends a RST.  The RST is acceptable so TCP B
  processes it and aborts the connection.
