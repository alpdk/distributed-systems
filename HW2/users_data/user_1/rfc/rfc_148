      SYN-RECEIVED

        If the security/compartment and precedence in the segment do not

        then send a reset, and return.

      ESTABLISHED STATE

        If the security/compartment and precedence in the segment do not
        exactly match the security/compartment and precedence in the TCB
        then send a reset, any outstanding RECEIVEs and SEND should
        receive "reset" responses.  All segment queues should be
        flushed.  Users should also receive an unsolicited general
        "connection reset" signal.  Enter the CLOSED state, delete the
        TCB, and return.
