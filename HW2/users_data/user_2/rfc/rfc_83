Transmission Control Protocol
Functional Specification



  Sequence Number:  32 bits

    The sequence number of the first data octet in this segment (except
    when SYN is present). If SYN is present the sequence number is the
    initial sequence number (ISN) and the first data octet is ISN+1.

  Acknowledgment Number:  32 bits

    If the ACK control bit is set this field contains the value of the
    next sequence number the sender of the segment is expecting to
    receive.  Once a connection is established this is always sent.

  Data Offset:  4
