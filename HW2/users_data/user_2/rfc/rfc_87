 In implementations of this
        kind (synchronous), there will still be some asynchronous
        signals, but these will deal with the connection itself, and not
        with specific segments or buffers.

        In order for the process to distinguish among error or success
        indications for different SENDs, it might be appropriate for the

        the SEND request.  TCP-to-user signals are discussed below,
        indicating the information which should be returned to the

      Receive

        Format:  RECEIVE (local connection name, buffer address, byte
        count) -> byte count, urgent flag, push flag

        This command allocates a receiving buffer associated with the
