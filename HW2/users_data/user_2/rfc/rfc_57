          If SND.UNA =< SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT then the ACK is acceptable.

SEGMENT ARRIVES



        If the RST bit is set

          If the ACK was acceptable then signal the user "error:
          connection reset", drop the segment, enter CLOSED state,
          delete TCB, and return.  Otherwise (no ACK) drop the segment
          and return.

      third check the security and precedence

        If the security/compartment in the segment does not exactly
        match the security/compartment in the TCB, send a reset

          If there is an ACK

            <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

          Otherwise

            <SEQ=0><ACK=SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN><CTL=RST,ACK>
