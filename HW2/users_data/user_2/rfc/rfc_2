imultaneous connection initiation is in progress.
  Proper use of "reset" segments can disambiguate these cases.

  Several examples of connection initiation follow.  Although these
  examples do not show connection synchronization using data-carrying
  segments, this is perfectly legitimate, so long as the receiving TCP
  doesn't deliver the data to the user until it is clear the data is
  valid (i.e., the data must be buffered at the receiver until the
  connection reaches the ESTABLISHED state).  The three-way handshake
  reduces the possibility of false connections.  It is the
