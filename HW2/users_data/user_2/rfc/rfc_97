   numbers in the sequence space, the numbers occupied by a segment are
    "busy" or "in use" until MSL seconds have passed, upon crashing a
    block of space-time is occupied by the octets of the last emitted
    segment, if a new connection is started too soon and uses any of the
    sequence numbers in the space-time footprint of the last segment of
    the previous connection incarnation, there is a potential sequence
    number overlap area which could cause confusion at the receiver.

3.4.  Establishing a connection

  The "three-way handshake" is the procedure used to establish a
  connection.  This procedure normally is initiated by one TCP and
  responded to by another TCP.  The procedure also works if two TCP
  simultaneously initiate the procedure.  When simultaneous attempt
  occurs, each TCP receives a "SYN" segment which carries no
  acknowledgment after it has sent a "SYN".  Of course, the arrival of
  an old duplicate "SYN" segment can potentially make it appear, to the
  recipient, that a s
