      specified, issue a SYN segment.  An initial send sequence number
      (ISS) is selected.  A SYN segment of the form <SEQ=ISS><CTL=SYN>
      is sent.  Set SND.UNA to ISS, SND.NXT to ISS+1, enter SYN-SENT
      state, and return.

      If the caller does not have access to the local socket specified,
      return "error:  connection illegal for this process".  If there is
      no room to create a new connection, return "error:  insufficient
      resources".

    LISTEN STATE

      If active and the foreign socket is specified, then change the
      connection from passive to active, select an ISS.  Send a SYN
      segment, set SND.UNA to ISS, SND.NXT to ISS+1.  Enter SYN-SENT
      state.  Data associated with SEND may be sent with SYN segment or
      queued for transmission after entering ESTABLISHED state.  The
      urgent bit if requested in the command must be sent with the data
      segments sent as a result of this command.  If there is no room to
