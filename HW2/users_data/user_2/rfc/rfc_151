    seventh, process the segment text,

      ESTABLISHED STATE
      FIN-WAIT-1 STATE
      FIN-WAIT-2 STATE

        Once in the ESTABLISHED state, it is possible to deliver segment
        text to user RECEIVE buffers.  Text from segments can be moved
        into buffers until either the buffer is full or the segment is
        empty.  If the segment empties and carries an PUSH flag, then
        the user is informed, when the buffer is returned, that a PUSH
        has been received.

        When the TCP takes responsibility for delivering the data to the
        user it must also acknowledge the receipt of the data.

        Once the TCP takes responsibility for the data it advances
        RCV.NXT over the data accepted, and adjusts RCV.WND as
        apporopriate to the current buffer availability.  The total of
        RCV.NXT and RCV.WND should not be reduced.

        Please note the window management suggestions in section 3.7.
