Transmission Control Protocol
Functional Specification



3.6.  Precedence and Security

  The intent is that connection be allowed only between ports operating
  with exactly the same security and compartment values and at the
  higher of the precedence level requested by the two ports.

  The precedence and security parameters used in TCP are exactly those
  defined in the Internet Protocol (IP) [2].  Throughout this TCP
  specification the term "security/compartment" is intended to indicate
  the security parameters used in IP including security, compartment,
  user group, and handling restriction.
