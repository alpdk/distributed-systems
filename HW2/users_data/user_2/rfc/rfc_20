 this state is a
          retransmission of the remote FIN.  Acknowledge it, and restart
          the 2 MSL timeout.

    sixth, check the URG bit,

      ESTABLISHED STATE
      FIN-WAIT-1 STATE
      FIN-WAIT-2 STATE

        If the URG bit is set, RCV.UP <- max(RCV.UP,SEG.UP), and signal
        the user that the remote side has urgent data if the urgent
        pointer (RCV.UP) is in advance of the data consumed.  If the
        user has already been signaled (or is still in the "urgent
        mode") for this continuous sequence of urgent data, do not
        signal the user again.
