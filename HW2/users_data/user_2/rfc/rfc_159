Functional Specification
                                                               OPEN Call



  OPEN Call

    CLOSED STATE (i.e., TCB does not exist)

      Create a new transmission control block (TCB) to hold connection
      state information.  Fill in local socket identifier, foreign
      socket, precedence, security/compartment, and user timeout
      information.  Note that some parts of the foreign socket may be
      unspecified in a passive OPEN and are to be filled in by the
      parameters of the incoming SYN segment.  Verify the security and
      precedence requested are allowed for this user, if not return
      "error:  precedence not allowed" or "error:  security/compartment
      not allowed."  If passive enter the LISTEN state and return.  If
      active and the foreign socket is unspecified, return "error:
      foreign socket unspecified"
