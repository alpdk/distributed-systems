ect an initial sequence
    number for each new connection incarnation).

    Suppose, for example, that a connection is opened starting with
    sequence number S.  Suppose that this connection is not used much
    and that eventually the initial sequence number function (ISN(t))
    takes on a value equal to the sequence number, say S1, of the last
    segment sent by this TCP on a particular connection.  Now suppose,
    at this instant, the host crashes, recovers, and establishes a new
    incarnation of the connection. The initial sequence number chosen is
    S1 = ISN(t) -- last used sequence number on old incarnation of
    connection!  If the recovery occurs quickly enough, any old
