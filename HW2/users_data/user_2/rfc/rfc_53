bits

    The number of 32 bit words in the TCP Header.  This indicates where
    the data begins.  The TCP header (even one including options) is an
    integral number of 32 bits long.

  Reserved:  6 bits

    Reserved for future use.  Must be zero.

  Control Bits:  6 bits (from left to right):

    URG:  Urgent Pointer field significant
    ACK:  Acknowledgment field significant
    PSH:  Push Function
    RST:  Reset the connection
    SYN:  Synchronize sequence numbers
    FIN:  No more data from sender

  Window:  16 bits

    The number of data octets beginning with the one indicated in the
    acknowledgment field which the sender of this segment is willing to
    accept.

  Checksum:  16 bits

    The checksum field is the 16 bit one's complement of the one's
    complement sum of all 16 bit words in the header and text.  If a
    segment contains an odd number of header and text octets to be
    checksummed, the last octet is padded on the right with zeros to
    form a 16 bit word for checksum pu
