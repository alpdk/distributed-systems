way handshake is necessary because sequence numbers are not
  tied to a global clock in the network, and TCPs may have different
  mechanisms for picking the ISN's.  The receiver of the first SYN has
  no way of knowing whether the segment was an old delayed one or not,
  unless it remembers the last sequence number used on the connection
  (which is not always possible), and so it must ask the sender to
  verify this SYN.  The three way handshake and the advantages of a
  clock-driven scheme are discussed in [3].

  Knowing When to Keep Quiet

  To be sure that a TCP does not create a segment that carries a
  sequence number which may be duplicated by an old segment remaining in
  the network, the TCP must keep quiet for a maximum segment lifetime
  (MSL) before assigning any sequence numbers upon starting up or
  recovering from a crash in which memory of sequence numbers in use was
  lost.  For this specification the MSL is taken to be 2 minutes.  This
  is an engineering choice, and may be changed if expe
