ed computing in which
  components act asynchronously with respect to each other.

  There are two principal cases for matching the sockets in the local
  passive OPENs and an foreign active OPENs.  In the first case, the
  local passive OPENs has fully specified the foreign socket.  In this
  case, the match must be exact.  In the second case, the local passive
  OPENs has left the foreign socket unspecified.  In this case, any
  foreign socket is acceptable as long as the local sockets match.
  Other possibilities include partially restricted matches.

  If there are several pending passive OPENs (recorded in TCBs) with the
  same local socket, an foreign active OPEN will be matched to a TCB
  with the specific foreign socket in the foreign active OPEN, if such a
  TCB exists, before selecting a TCB with an unspecif
