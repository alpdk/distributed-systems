  A variety of other cases are possible, all of which are accounted for
  by the following rules for RST generation and processing.

  Reset Generation

  As a general rule, reset (RST) must be sent whenever a segment arrives
  which apparently is not intended for the current connection.  A reset
  must not be sent if it is not clear that this is the case.

  There are three groups of states:

    1.  If the connection does not exist (CLOSED) then a reset is sent
    in response to any incoming segment except another reset.  In
    particular, SYNs addressed to a non-existent connection are rejected
    by this means.

    If the incoming segment has an ACK field, the reset takes its
    sequence number from the ACK field of the segment, otherwise the
