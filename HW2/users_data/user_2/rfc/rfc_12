last sequence number expected on an incoming
        segment, and is the right or upper edge of the receive window

    SEG.SEQ = first sequence number occupied by the incoming segment

    SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 = last sequence number occupied by the incoming
        segment

  A segment is judged to occupy a portion of valid receive sequence
  space if

    RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

  or

    RCV.NXT =< SEG.SEQ+SEG.LEN-1 < RCV.NXT+RCV.WND

Functional Specification



  The first part of this test checks to see if the beginning of the
  segment falls in the window, the second part of the test checks to see
  if the end of the segment falls in the window; if the segment passes
  either part of the test it contains data in the window.

  Actually, it is a little more complicated than this.  Due to zero
  windows and zero leng
