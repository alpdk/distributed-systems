  reset has sequence number zero and the ACK field is set to the sum
    of the sequence number and segment length of the incoming segment.
    The connection remains in the CLOSED state.

    2.  If the connection is in any non-synchronized state (LISTEN,
    SYN-SENT, SYN-RECEIVED), and the incoming segment acknowledges
    something not yet sent (the segment carries an unacceptable ACK), or
    if an incoming segment has a security level or compartment which
    does not exactly match the level and compartment requested for the
    connection, a reset is sent.

    If our SYN has not been acknowledged and the precedence level of the
    incoming segment is higher than the precedence level requested then
    either raise the local precedence level (if allowed by the user and
    the system) or send a reset; or if the precedence level of the
    incoming segment is lower than the precedence level requested then
    continue as if the precedence matched exactly (if the remote TCP
    cannot raise the preceden
