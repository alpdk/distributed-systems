nction in
  a multilevel secure environment; some may be limited to unclassified
  use only, and others may operate at only one security level and
  compartment.  Consequently, some TCP implementations and services to
  users may be limited to a subset of the multilevel secure case.

  TCP modules which operate in a multilevel secure environment must
  properly mark outgoing segments with the security, compartment, and
  precedence.  Such TCP modules must also provide to their users or
  higher level protocols such as Telnet or THP an interface to allow
  them to specify the desired security level, compartment, and
  precedence of connections.

2.10.  Robustness Principle

  TCP implementations will follow a general principle of robustness:  be
  conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from
  others.
