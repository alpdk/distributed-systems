 timeouts.  This section describes the
  processing the TCP does in response to each of the events.  In many
  cases the processing required depends on the state of the connection.

    Events that occur:

      User Calls

        OPEN
        SEND
        RECEIVE
        CLOSE
        ABORT
        STATUS

      Arriving Segments

        SEGMENT ARRIVES

      Timeouts

        USER TIMEOUT
        RETRANSMISSION TIMEOUT
        TIME-WAIT TIMEOUT

  The model of the TCP/user interface is that user commands receive an
  immediate return and possibly a delayed response via an event or
  pseudo interrupt.  In the following descriptions, the term "signal"
  means cause a delayed response.

  Error responses are given as character strings.  For example, user
  commands referencing connections that do not exist receive "error:
  connection not open".

  Please note in the following that all arithmetic on sequence numbers,
  acknowledgment numbers, windows, et cetera, is modulo 2**32 the size
  of the sequence nu
