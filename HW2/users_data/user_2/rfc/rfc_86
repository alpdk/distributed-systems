 a SEND.

        A transmission control block (TCB) is created and partially
        filled in with data from the OPEN command parameters.

        On an active OPEN command, the TCP will begin the procedure to
        synchronize (i.e., establish) the connection at once.

        The timeout, if present, permits the caller to set up a timeout
        for all data submitted to TCP.  If data is not successfully
        delivered to the destination within the timeout period, the TCP
        will abort the connection.  The present global default is five
