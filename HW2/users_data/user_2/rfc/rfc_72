A connection attempt with mismatched security/compartment values or a
  lower precedence value must be rejected by sending a reset.  Rejecting
  a connection due to too low a precedence only occurs after an
  acknowledgment of the SYN has been received.

  Note that TCP modules which operate only at the default value of
  precedence will still have to check the precedence of incoming
  segments and possibly raise the precedence level they use on the
  connection.

  The security paramaters may be used even in a non-secure environment
  (the values would indicate unclassified data), thus hosts in
  non-secure environments must be prepared to receive the security
  parameters, though they need not send them.

3.7.  Data Communication

  Once the connection is established data is communicated by the
  exchange of segments.  Because segments may be lost due to errors
  (checksum test failure), or network congestion, TCP uses
  retransmission (after a timeout) to ensure delivery of every segment.
