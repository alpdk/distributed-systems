 number in the sequence field of the arriving segment.

send sequence
          This is the next sequence number the local (sending) TCP will
          use on the connection.  It is initially selected from an
          initial sequence number curve (ISN) and is incremented for
          each octet of data or sequenced control transmitted.

send window
          This represents the sequence numbers which the remote
          (receiving) TCP is willing to receive.  It is the value of the
          window field specified in segments from the remote (data
          receiving) TCP.  The range of new sequence numbers which may
          be emitted by a TCP lies between SND.NXT and
          SND.UNA + SND.WND - 1. (Retransmissions of sequence numbers
          between SND.UNA and SND.NXT are expected, of course.)

SND.NXT
          send sequence

SND.UNA
          left sequence

SND.UP
          send urgent pointer

SND.WL1
          segment sequence number at last window update

SND.WL2
          segment acknowledg
