onsecutive sequence numbers
    as there are octets of data in the segment.

    Under normal conditions, TCPs keep track of the next sequence number
    to emit and the oldest awaiting acknowledgment so as to avoid
    mistakenly using a sequence number over before its first use has
    been acknowledged.  This alone does not guarantee that old duplicate
    data is drained from the net, so the sequence space has been made
    very large to reduce the probability that a wandering duplicate will
    cause trouble upon arrival.  At 2 megabits/sec. it takes 4.5 hours
    to use up 2**32 octets of sequence space.  Since the maximum segment
    lifetime in the net is not likely to exceed a few tens of seconds,
    this is deemed ample protection for foreseeable nets, even if data
    rates escalate to l0's of megabits/sec.  At 100 megabits/sec, the
    cycle time is 5.4 minutes which may be a little short, but still
    within reason.

    The basic duplicate detection and sequencing algorithm in TCP can be
