        In the following it is assumed that the segment is the idealized
        segment that begins at RCV.NXT and does not exceed the window.
        One could tailor actual segments to fit this assumption by
        trimming off any portions that lie outside the window (including
        SYN and FIN), and only processing further if the segment then
        begins at RCV.NXT.  Segments with higher begining sequence
        numbers may be held for later processing.

    second check the RST bit,

      SYN-RECEIVED STATE

        If the RST bit is set

          If this connection was initiated with a passive OPEN (i.e.,
          came from the LISTEN state), then return this connection to
          LISTEN state and return.  The user need
