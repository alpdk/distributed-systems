        are acceptable then, RCV.NXT is set to SEG.SEQ+1, IRS is set to
        SEG.SEQ.  SND.UNA should be advanced to equal SEG.ACK (if there
        is an ACK), and any segments on the retransmission queue which
        are thereby acknowledged should be removed.

        If SND.UNA > ISS (our SYN has been ACKed), change the connection
        state to ESTABLISHED, form an ACK segment

          <SEQ=SND.NXT><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>

        and send it.  Data or controls which were queued for
        transmission may be included.  If there are other controls or
        text in the segment then continue processing at the sixth step
        below where the URG bit is checked, otherwise return.

        Otherwise enter SYN-RECEIVED, form a SYN,ACK segment

          <SEQ=ISS><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=SYN,ACK>

        and send it.  If there are other controls or
