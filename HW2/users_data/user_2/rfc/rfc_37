ment from an old connection between these ports with a
      different security or precedence from causing an abort of the
      current connection.

    fourth, check the SYN bit,

      SYN-RECEIVED
      ESTABLISHED STATE
      FIN-WAIT STATE-1
      FIN-WAIT STATE-2
      CLOSE-WAIT STATE
      CLOSING STATE
      LAST-ACK STATE
      TIME-WAIT STATE

        If the SYN is in the window it is an error, send a reset, any
        outstanding RECEIVEs and SEND should receive "reset" responses,
        all segment queues should be flushed, the user should also
        receive an unsolicited general "connection reset" signal, enter
        the CLOSED state, delete the TCB, and return.

        If the SYN is not in the window this step would not be reached
        and an ack would have been sent in the first step (sequence
        number check).
