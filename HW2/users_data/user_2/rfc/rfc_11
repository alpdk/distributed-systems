        If the SEG.PRC is greater than the TCB.PRC then if allowed by
        the user and the system set TCB.PRC<-SEG.PRC, if not allowed
        send a reset and return.

          <SEQ=SEG.ACK><CTL=RST>

        If the SEG.PRC is less than the TCB.PRC then continue.

        Set RCV.NXT to SEG.SEQ+1, IRS is set to SEG.SEQ and any other
        control or text should be queued for processing later.  ISS
        should be selected and a SYN segment sent of the form:

          <SEQ=ISS><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=SYN,ACK>

        SND.NXT is set to ISS+1 and SND.UNA to ISS.  The connection
        state should be changed to SYN-RECEIVED.  Note that any other
        incoming control or data (combined with SYN) will be
